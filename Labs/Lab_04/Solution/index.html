                <li><h1>Question: What are different parts of a CSS style rule?</h1></li>
                <li><h2>Answer: A CSS rule-set consists of a selector and a declaration block. The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.The selector points to the HTML element you want to style. The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon. A CSS declaration always ends with a semicolon, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces. </h2></li>
                <li><h1>Question: What is the difference between a relative and absolute measure unit in CSS?</h1></li>
                <li><h2>Answer: The units in which length is measured can be either absolute such as pixels, points and so on, or relative such as percentages (%) and (em) units. Relative units give a length relative to another length property, and are preferred since they will better adjust to different media.</h2></li>
                <li><h1>Question: What are an element selector and grouped element selector in CSS? Provide an example of each.</h1></li>
                <li><h2>Answer: The element selector selects all elements with the specified element name. When several selectors share the same declarations, they may be grouped into a comma-separated list. Example: id and class</h2></li>
                <li><h1>Question: What are class selectors in CSS? What are id selectors in CSS?</h1></li>
                <li><h2>Answer: CSS can use the id attribute of an element to specify a style for that element (and that element alone). CSS can use the class attribute of an element to specify a style for that element (for multiple elements of the same type).</h2></li>
                <li><h1>Question: What are contextual selectors in CSS?</h1></li>
                <li><h2>Answer: A contextual selector matches when an element is an arbitrary descendent of some ancestor element. A contextual selector is made up of two or more selectors separated by white space.</h2></li>
